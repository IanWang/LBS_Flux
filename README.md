## Feature

- Auth.
- Get current location and make it as center of the Google map.
- Click on map to add Place, show it as a mark.
- Click on mark to check in.

## todos

- Still lack of tests. When I found out that jest may not support ajax test, it was too late.
- Some missing features, like register user devices, follow others, and checkins feed. 
- UX problem related to google map APIs.
